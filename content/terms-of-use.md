### Disclaimer
No warranties, either express or implied, are hereby given for anything provided by Manjaro Linux ("Software"). All software is supplied without any accompanying guarantee, whether expressly mentioned, implied or tacitly assumed.

### Free Software and Manjaro Linux
Manjaro develops free software. All our tools (Pamac, MSM, Manjaro-Tools) are and will always be free software. Manjaro Linux is part of <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/community-of-licensees/">OIN</a> since March 2014. The current license can be viewed <a href="https://openinventionnetwork.com/joining-oin/join-now/license-agreement/">here</a>. Additional information about packages covered by this license can be viewed <a href="https://openinventionnetwork.com/joining-oin/join-now/">here</a>.</p><p data-block-key="33i7e">It is not our goal to make Manjaro a distro free of proprietary software, like <a href="http://trisquel.info/">Trisquel</a> or <a href="http://www.gnewsense.org/">gNewSense</a>. While you can use Manjaro without non-free software, our repositories also contain non-free software you can install. So, while it will always be possible to have a Manjaro with free software only, we will ship any software we can as long as our users ask for it and our packers are willing to prepare it for them.</p><p data-block-key="7h8bj">If you want to check the license of a package, you can do so with Pacman. Also, check if there is a folder called <i>/usr/share/licenses/</i> in your system; if so, it should contain license information for that package.</p><p data-block-key="cdvh1">Our live media give you the choice to boot with free or non-free drivers, so you can check before installing which one you want to use.
