Finding information within Manjaro Linux always as been a topic that needed to be solved. Available search engines are quite good if we know how to do research and know what we looking for, but sometimes we have to scroll to thousands of links to find what we looking for, with our new website search, all Manjaro data is accessible in one place and divided by sections so it is easier to digest.

The data is pulled from 11 sources, making it a very convenient way to find anything you are looking for, including documentation, git repositories or issues, forum solutions for common problems you might experience or package sources.

You can directly search for packages, being in native format (aka pkgbuild), snap or flatpak. Those can also be installed directly from the search results on an individual basis.

The web installer has been around for maybe 2 years and is based on libpamac although it works is still considered in alpha stage and could do with some more rework in the future.
