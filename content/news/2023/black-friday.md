Hello community,

with Manjaro we have a great operating system suitable for a lot of devices. Most of you might install it on already owned hardware or keep older gear up and running when the original OS it was shipped doesn't offer updates anymore.

Over time however, we have partnered up with many Hardware manufacturers and vendors which support our project by sharing revenue of their sales when devices with Manjaro pre-installed got sold. With today, the day after Thanksgiving, most of them have special offers you might want to check out. Before that, let's figure out what "Black Friday" is all about:

For centuries, the adjective "black" has been applied to days upon which calamities occurred. Many events have been described as "Black Friday", although the most significant such event in American history was the Panic of 1869, which occurred when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk took advantage of their connections with the Grant Administration in an attempt to corner the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18%. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president's own brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, was ruined.

The earliest known use of "Black Friday" to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, Factory Management and Maintenance, for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day week-end. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms "Black Friday" and "Black Saturday" came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and Rochester to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days "Big Friday" and "Big Saturday,‚Äù but these terms were quickly forgotten.
