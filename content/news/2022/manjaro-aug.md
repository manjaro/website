### General Package updates highlights:

* Gamers are happy about the <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Glibc-2.36-EAC-Problems">EAC issues</a> for Steam got fixed

As usual, regular packages like Firefox, Thunderbird, Cinnamon and others got renewed.

### Website
The manjaro website keeps evolving every month behind the curtains, some UI rework in the download section, a complete redesign of the menu system and a new documentation area.

Documentation is always a topic for us that needs to be improved, most notably developer documentation, there is the <a href="https://wiki.manjaro.org">Wiki</a> that is a community made source, community users also provide <a href="https://forum.manjaro.org/c/contributions/tutorials">mini guides</a> via our forums. There is also Gitlab documentation and some lose <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdGFLV7h9RGeTUX7wa5rqGw/videos">video tutorials</a>.

The new documentation area aims to bridge all those sources in a single place that can be consulted in a way that is not extremely technical so anyone can get started quickly.

### Calamares UI Changes
Calamares has received a more polished user interface. The UI was partially redesigned in QML giving a more fluid and enjoyable installation process, some cool child-out animations and text rework. Those should be available soon after we are happy with testing and all the bugs are iron out.
