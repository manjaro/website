Manjaro is not only a community project that provides one of the most widely used Linux distributions, but since 2019 Manjaro has also been incorporated as a German company. This incorporation allows commercial vendors and consumers to have an official partner to engage with.

Until now the Manjaro company was led by Philip Müller and Bernhard Landauer, both esteemed members of the Manjaro community. This has now changed, with Bernhard leaving the company to focus on other professional endeavors. We are pleased, though, that he will remain an active part of the Manjaro community and continue to contribute to the development of the Manjaro Linux distribution.

Roman Gilg will succeed Bernhard in the company's management, bringing additional technical expertise as the new CTO of the Manjaro company. Roman is recognized for his work as a software engineer and project lead on various open-source projects within the Linux graphics space.

The Manjaro company is committed to supporting the ongoing development of the Manjaro Linux distribution. Additionally, we will continue collaborating with industry partners to develop desirable products powered by Manjaro. We have further plans to enhance Manjaro's impact on the software world, and we look forward to sharing more details soon.
