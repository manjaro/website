**Hello Community,**

some of our team will attend FOSDEM 2024 in Brussels. You can meet us in person on the weekend of 3 & 4 February 2024 at ULB Campus du Solbosch. We bring some Manjaro stickers and gaming gear to test. It will be a great opportunity to talk about future plans and direction of the Manjaro project, to share our passion with like-minded individuals and get first hand infos about upcoming devices powered by Manjaro Linux!

We will also meet with some of our partners and projects we are involved in: <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a>, <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com">CodeWeavers</a>, <a href="https://www.pine64.org/">Pine64</a> and <a href="https://blog.blendos.co/">BlendOS</a> to mention just a few.
